```lrc
[00:17.58] i hold on to all the things
[00:22.96] that make me think of you
[00:26.92] i kept all your letters and
[00:33.77] sometimes, late at night i read them through
[00:40.82] i follow the ink on the page that expains all the things
[00:50.26] that youd never say to my face
[00:54.90] i wish you still felt this way
[01:07.47] i wish you still felt this way
[01:14.33] it's been a couple months since we talked
[01:20.06] i have a bunch of things that
[01:24.46] remind me of you And i keep them in a box
[01:31.11] i wrote a page of poetry to maybe send to you someday
[01:44.29] i wrote you a letter but i'm scared of what it says
[01:58.03] i wish that you still felt this way
[02:06.12] i wish you still felt this way
